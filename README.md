# The-Mondrian-Test
## This is a coding challenge I recieved. The challenge was to: 
  -Build a page/app with the following
  -6 rows of 10 squares that fill the entire width of the screen
  -Each square contains 2 rectangles
  -The rectangles in the squares alternate between horizontal and vertical
  -The rectangles should have a border
  -When clicking a square, the 2 rectangles change color
  *At least 1 of the 2 rectangles must be white
  *The other can be red, white, blue, or yellow
